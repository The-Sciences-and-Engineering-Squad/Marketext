## Marketext
School project for CSc 473 - Website Design Course, with Prof. Michelle Sasson, at the City College of New York

Contributors: Kevin Chen, Albert Felix, Eddie Ozuna, & Dor Ulman

## App Concept:
Marketext is a web application where users can buy, sell, trade, and swap school textbooks. These four options are described as follows:
- **Buy**: Users are able to make postings for a textbook that they wish to sell, and can include the price that they are looking to sell it for as well as the condition that the textbook is in.
- **Sell**: Users are able to search for textbooks that they may be looking to purchase, browsing through listings according to price, condition, edition, etc.
- **Trade**: Users are able to trade a textbook they own for another specific textbook they are looking for. The owner lists the textbooks that they are willing to trade it for, with value not playing a factor.
- **Swap**: Users are able to swap a textbook that they already own for something else, with more flexibility on what they are looking for. Users are not looking for anything specific; instead, they are open to offers, and value does play a factor.

## Tools:
- **Frontend**: React, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Others**: Travis CI
